# IFFMOD
A tool that allows you to add song name, artist info, comments, a starting tempo, a volume override, and VBlank timing to ProTracker MOD files by adding IFF headers.

I originally wrote the majority of this in two days (July 27-28) with some minor bugfixes done within a span of two more days (July 29-30).

## Contents
This repository includes the addition and stripping tools as one application and documentation for the header that the ProTracker IFF format uses.

## Requirements
This code requires Python 3.10.x to run.

## Tests done
Works correctly with blank text fields.
