# IFFMOD
A ProTracker MOD to ProTracker IFF conversion tool I wrote in Python in a span of 2 days.

Allows you to add song name, artist info, comments, a starting tempo, and a volume override to ProTracker MOD files by adding IFF headers.

I originally wrote the majority of this in two days (July 27-28) with some minor bugfixes done within a span of two more days (July 29-30).

## Contents
This repository includes the conversion tool and documentation for the ProTracker IFF format, excluding the MOD format documentation.

## Requirements
This code requires Python 3.10 to run.

## Tests done
Works correctly with blank fields.
